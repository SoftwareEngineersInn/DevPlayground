 * There exists to potential problems if this application grows:
 * <p>
 * - High Coupling
 * If InvoicePrinter changes its constructor method or a new dependency is required. We will need to update our
 * Invoice service class as well
 * <p>
 * - Testing difficulty
 * This approach will add extra difficulty to create mock for testing because it creates its own dependencies.

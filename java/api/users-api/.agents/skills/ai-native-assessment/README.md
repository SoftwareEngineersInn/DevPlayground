# AI-Native Assessment

Use `ai-native-assessment` to evaluate how AI-native a repository is. The skill first scans the repo for AI primitives - spec-driven development, deterministic checks, AI skills, documentation, IDE configuration, and agentic legibility - and uses that evidence to produce a scored markdown report with prioritized recommended actions.

Visit the [AI-Native Maturity Leaderboard](https://cisco-genai.github.io/ai-native-maturity-leaderboard) to view how repositories compare.

## Two Installation Options

You can install this skill with either `apm` or `npx skills`.

## Private Repository Access Prerequisites

Before installing from `cisco-genai/awesome-cisco`, make sure your GitHub account has access to the `cisco-genai` org and that your token is authorized for it.

1. Join one of the below Cisco MyID groups:
   - Cisco IT users: [emu-org-cisco-it-group](https://myid-groups.cisco.com/group-details/name/emu-org-cisco-it-group)
   - Everyone else: [emu-org-cisco-genai-contributors](https://myid-groups.cisco.com/group-details/name/emu-org-cisco-genai-contributors)
2. Create a GitHub personal access token:
   - Fine-grained PAT: [github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new)
   - Classic PAT: [github.com/settings/tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
3. Set the token locally:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_pat>
```

4. Authorize the PAT for the `cisco-genai` org in GitHub:
   - Manage tokens: [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - If your token shows `Configure SSO`, use it and authorize the token for `cisco-genai`.

## Option 1: Install With APM

Use this option when you want the skill managed as a dependency and deployed to one or more supported targets.

### Prerequisites

- Install APM if needed: `curl -sSL https://aka.ms/apm-unix | sh`
- Verify APM: `apm --version`
- Initialize APM in the repo if needed: `apm init --yes`

### Install The Skill

```bash
apm install cisco-genai/awesome-cisco/skills/ai-native-assessment -t opencode -t cursor -t copilot
```

Notes:

- Adjust the `-t` targets to match the tools you use.
- For OpenCode only, `-t opencode` is enough.
- For private repository access, ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` is exported in your shell before running `apm install`.

### Verify The Install

```bash
apm deps list
apm deps tree
```

## Option 2: Install With `npx skills`

Use this option when you want to add the skill directly from the repository without managing it through APM.

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/cisco-genai/awesome-cisco --skill ai-native-assessment
```

You can verify the CLI and installed skills with:

```bash
npx skills --version
npx skills list
```

## How To Invoke It

Some AI CLIs expose installed skills as slash commands. When they do, prefer invoking `ai-native-assessment` that way.

### OpenCode

```text
Use the ai-native-assessment skill for this repository.
```

### Cursor

```text
/ai-native-assessment
```

### GitHub Copilot Chat

```text
/ai-native-assessment
```

### Claude Code

```text
/ai-native-assessment
```

## Bundled Detection Script

The skill includes `scripts/detect.py` for fast deterministic discovery.

Default mode returns candidates, selected commands, additional scans, category signals, and AI validation hints so the model can make the scoring decisions:

```bash
python3 scripts/detect.py <repo_root>
```

If you want the script to also include deterministic category scores and recommended actions, opt in explicitly:

```bash
python3 scripts/detect.py <repo_root> --with-scoring
```

## Typical Outputs

Depending on the repository's current state, the skill produces:

- `docs/ai-native-scorecard.md` — the completed scorecard, formatted to match `templates/ai-native-scorecard.md`, with per-sub-metric scores, category averages, composite score, and tier assignment
- A prioritized list of recommended actions ordered by composite impact
- An optional pull request to the [AI-Native Maturity Leaderboard](https://cisco-genai.github.io/ai-native-maturity-leaderboard)

## What The Skill Does

The assessment evaluates six weighted categories and computes a composite score on a 0–4 scale:

| # | Category | Weight |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Spec-Driven Development | 20% |
| 2 | Deterministic Checks | 25% |
| 3 | AI Tooling & Skills | 15% |
| 4 | Documentation Tree | 15% |
| 5 | AI IDE Configuration | 10% |
| 6 | Agentic Legibility | 15% |

The Spec-Driven Development category is tool-agnostic. It recognizes the major SDD frameworks — OpenSpec, SpecKit, BMAD (BMAD-METHOD), and GSD (Git. Ship. Done.) — and also scores generic, homegrown, or other spec-driven workflows (for example, a `specs/` directory holding real planning artifacts). Every framework is evaluated on the same rubric, and no tool is favored or can reach a higher score than another. The score reflects the substance of the work — that a system exists, work items carry complete planning artifacts, the workflow is used, and it is documented — not which tool produced it.

Based on the composite score, the repository is assigned a maturity tier:

| Composite Score | Tier |
|-----------------|------|
| 0.0 – 0.9 | Unaware |
| 1.0 – 1.9 | Nascent |
| 2.0 – 2.9 | Structured |
| 3.0 – 3.5 | Established |
| 3.6 – 4.0 | Exemplary |

The skill writes a completed scorecard to `docs/ai-native-scorecard.md` using the exact section and table structure from `templates/ai-native-scorecard.md`, and optionally submits it to the leaderboard via a pull request.

## Good Times To Use It

- After running `ai-harness-setup` to verify and measure what was set up
- Before starting AI workflow improvements to establish a baseline
- Periodically to track maturity progress over time
- When onboarding a repo into an AI-native engineering practice

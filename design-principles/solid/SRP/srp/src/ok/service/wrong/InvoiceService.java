 * There exists to potential problems if this application grows:
 *
 * - High Coupling
 *      If InvoicePrinter changes its constructor method or a new dependency is required. We will need to update our
 *      Invoice service class as well
 *
 * - Testing difficulty
 *      This approach will add extra difficulty to create mock for testing because it creates its own dependencies.
